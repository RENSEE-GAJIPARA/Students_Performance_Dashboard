## 📌 Overview

The **Student Performance Dashboard** is an interactive **Power BI** report that analyzes the **academic performance, attendance, and behavior** of 1,000 students across multiple classes, subjects, and exam terms. It was built as a practical exam project to demonstrate skills in **data modeling, DAX, visualization, and storytelling**.

The dashboard helps teachers and administrators quickly identify:
- 🎯 Which subjects or classes are underperforming
- 📅 Attendance trends and irregularities
- 🧠 Behavioral patterns across students
- 📈 Performance trends term over term

---


## 📁 Dataset

The report is built on four relational CSV datasets:

| File | Columns | Records |
|------|----------|---------|
| `Students.csv` | `StudentID`, `Name`, `Gender`, `Class`, `Section` | 1,000 |
| `Scores.csv` | `StudentID`, `Subject`, `ExamType`, `Score`, `MaxScore`, `Term` | 30,000 |
| `Attendance.csv` | `StudentID`, `Date`, `Status` (Present/Absent), `Reason` | 100,000 |
| `Behavior.csv` | `StudentID`, `Date`, `BehaviorType`, `Notes` | 6,500 |

> 💡 `StudentID` is the common key linking all four tables together.

---

## 🧩 Data Model

A **star-schema** style model was created in Power BI, with `Students` as the central dimension table connected to three fact tables (`Scores`, `Attendance`, `Behavior`) via one-to-many relationships on `StudentID`.

**Relationships:**
- `Students[StudentID]` → `Scores[StudentID]` (1 → *)
- `Students[StudentID]` → `Attendance[StudentID]` (1 → *)
- `Students[StudentID]` → `Behavior[StudentID]` (1 → *)

The main **Academic Dashboard** page includes KPI cards, subject/class-wise performance bars, attendance status donut chart, performance trend line, and a detailed student-level score table with conditional formatting.

The report also includes **Behavioural Insights** and **Student Profile** drillthrough pages, accessible from the left navigation pane.

---

## 🧮 DAX Measures

The following calculated fields and measures were created to power the visuals:

```dax
Score % = DIVIDE(SUM(Scores[Score]), SUM(Scores[MaxScore]))

Average Score per Subject =
AVERAGEX(VALUES(Scores[Subject]), [Score %])

Attendance % =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Attendance), Attendance[Status] = "Present"),
    COUNTROWS(Attendance)
)

Behavior Count per Type =
CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Behavior), ALLEXCEPT(Behavior, Behavior[BehaviorType]))

Performance Category =
SWITCH(
    TRUE(),
    [Score %] >= 0.8, "High",
    [Score %] >= 0.4, "Medium",
    "Low"
)
```

## 📊 Visualizations

| Visual Type | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 📶 **Bar Chart** | Average scores by Subject and Class |
| 📈 **Line Chart** | Performance trend across Terms |
| 🍩 **Donut Chart** | Attendance status & Behavior type distribution |
| 📋 **Table** | Student-wise scores with conditional formatting (green ≥ 80%, red < 40%) |
| 🧾 **Card Visuals** | KPIs — Total Students, Average Attendance, Average Score, Total Behavioural Records, Total Subjects |

---

## 🎛️ Interactivity Features

- 🔍 **Slicers** for Class, Section, Subject, and Term
- 🔗 **Drillthrough page** for individual student profiles
- 🧭 **Bookmark navigation** to switch between Academic and Behavioral views
- 🖱️ **Tooltips** with mini charts and metrics on hover

## 🛠️ Steps Performed (.pbix Build Process)

The dashboard was built end-to-end in Power BI Desktop following this workflow:

1. **Data Collection** — Organized the four source files (`Students.csv`, `Scores.csv`, `Attendance.csv`, `Behavior.csv`) inside a dedicated `Datasets` folder.
2. **Data Import** — Loaded all CSV files into Power BI using **Get Data → Text/CSV**.
3. **Data Cleaning (Power Query)** — Renamed columns consistently, corrected data types (dates, numbers, text), and handled null/missing values where appropriate.
4. **Data Modeling** — Built relationships between `Students` (1) and `Scores`, `Attendance`, `Behavior` (each *) using `StudentID` as the key, forming a star schema.
5. **DAX Measures** — Created calculated measures: `% Score`, `Average Score per Subject`, `Attendance %`, `Behavior Count per Type`, and `Performance Category` (using `SWITCH`/`IF`).
6. **Report Page 1 – Academic Dashboard** — Added KPI cards, bar charts (score by subject/class), donut chart (attendance status), and line chart (performance trend by term).
7. **Report Page 2 – Behavioural Insights** — Visualized behavior type distribution and trends using donut/bar charts.
8. **Report Page 3 – Student Profile (Drillthrough)** — Configured a drillthrough page to view individual student details on click.
9. **Conditional Formatting** — Applied color rules to the score table (green for high scores, red for low scores).
10. **Slicers & Filters** — Added slicers for Class, Section, Subject, and Term to enable dynamic filtering.
11. **Bookmarks & Navigation** — Set up bookmarks and a navigation pane to toggle between report views.
12. **Tooltips** — Designed custom tooltip pages with mini visuals for richer hover details.
13. **Testing & Validation** — Verified that all visuals interacted correctly with slicers and drillthroughs.
14. **Export & Save** — Saved the final report as `Student_Performance_Dashboard.pbix` and exported a PDF snapshot (`Student_Performance_Report.pdf`).
